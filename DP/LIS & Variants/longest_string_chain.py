#   NOTE - Since this problem is a variant of LIS (only difference is that we can pick the element/word in any order)
#   So we sort the input in ascending order of their length to get the longest string chain as per condition.
#   Also, since it's variant of LIS, it can be solved using all those methods by which LIS could be solved.
